You can use Python to automatically parse through a folder and rename all the files in that folder by using the os and os.path modules to manipulate
file names and the os.listdir() function to get a list of files in the folder. Additionally, you can use regular expressions from the re module to 
match and replace parts of the file names.

Here's a step-by-step guide with examples:

Import Necessary Libraries:
First, import the required Python libraries:

import os
import re

Specify the Folder Path:
Define the folder path where your files are located:

folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'

List Files in the Folder:
Use os.listdir() to get a list of all files in the folder:

files = os.listdir(folder_path)

Define a Rename Function:
Create a function that takes a filename and returns the new name you want to assign to it. You can use regular expressions to match and replace
parts of the filename. For example, let's say you want to replace all spaces with underscores:

def rename_file(filename):
    new_name = re.sub(r' ', '_', filename)
    return new_name

Rename the Files:
Loop through the list of files and rename each one using the os.rename() function:

for filename in files:
    old_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
    new_name = rename_file(filename)
    new_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_name)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)

In this example, we used the os.path.join() function to create full file paths for both the old and new names.

Here's a complete example that renames all files in a folder by replacing spaces with underscores:

import os
import re

def rename_file(filename):
    new_name = re.sub(r' ', '_', filename)
    return new_name

folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'
files = os.listdir(folder_path)

for filename in files:
    old_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
    new_name = rename_file(filename)
    new_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_name)
    os.rename(old_path, new_path)

Make sure to replace '/path/to/your/folder' with the actual path to your folder. This script will go through all the files in the folder and replace
spaces with underscores in their names.

You can customize the rename_file function and the renaming logic based on your specific requirements. Just modify the regular expression or other string
manipulation functions within the function to achieve the desired naming convention.
