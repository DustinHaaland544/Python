In Python, the else clause can be used with loops (both for and while loops) to execute a block of code after the loop completes normally. This means the else block runs if the 

loop is not terminated by a break statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed and simplified explanation:

1. for Loop with else

The else block in a for loop runs after the loop has iterated over all items in the sequence. If the loop is interrupted by a break statement, the else block will not be executed.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        print("Found 3!")
        break
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop completed without finding 3.")

Explanation:

- The loop iterates over each number in the list numbers.

- When num is 3, it prints "Found 3!" and then breaks out of the loop.

- Since the loop was terminated by a break statement, the else block does not execute.

If the loop did not have the number 3 or there was no break statement, the else block would run.

Example without break:

numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop completed without finding 3.")

Explanation:

- The loop prints each number in the list.

- Since there is no break statement and the loop completes normally, the else block is executed, printing "Loop completed without finding 3."

2. while Loop with else

The else block in a while loop runs after the loop condition becomes false. If the loop is terminated by a break statement, the else block will not be executed.

Example:

count = 0

while count < 5:
    if count == 3:
        print("Count is 3, breaking the loop!")
        break
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed without breaking.")

Explanation:

- The loop runs while count is less than 5.

- When count becomes 3, it prints "Count is 3, breaking the loop!" and breaks out of the loop.

- Since the loop is terminated by a break statement, the else block does not execute.

If the loop runs without hitting the break statement, the else block will run.

count = 0

while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed without breaking.")

Explanation:

- The loop runs while count is less than 3.

- The loop prints 0, 1, and 2.

- When count becomes 3, the condition count < 3 is false, and the loop exits normally.

- The else block is executed, printing "Loop completed without breaking."

Key Points to Remember:

- The else block runs if the loop completes normally (i.e., it is not exited by a break statement).

- For for loops, this means iterating over all items in the sequence.

- For while loops, this means the loop condition becomes false.

- If a break statement is used to exit the loop, the else block will not run.

Understanding this behavior can help you write more intuitive and error-free code by clearly defining what should happen if a loop completes its iterations or exits prematurely.

Example without break:
