Lecture-48: Overview of Quick Function Exercises # 1 - 10

Okay so you now know functions!

A big part of this section of the course will be testing your new skills with exercises. We have 3 main parts of exercises.


Part-1: 10 In Course Coding Exercises

We're going to start off with just the basics with a series of 10 problems. These problems should feel relatively easy, just some quick exercises to get you comfortable with the syntax of 

functions. If you feel uncomfortable with these, check out lecture 26 for some useful links for warm-up problems from codingbat.com, but hopefully these exercises should feel relatively 

easy. 

These are in-course coding exercises. Solutions can be found linked here:

In between these in-course coding exercises we'll have a quick lecture on *args and **kwargs.


Part-2: Function Practice Exercises

Here we'll have a jupyter notebook with some exercises for you to answer, we'll have a quick overview lecture, and then you attempt problems, afterwards we'll have an explanatory solutions

video. These problems are ranked WarmUp, Level1, Level2, and Challenge. You should feel comfortable with WarmUp and Level1 and Level2. Challenge problems here are very difficult, so don't 

feel bad if you don't want to attempt them yet! :)


Part-3: Function and Methods Homework

We finish off this section with even more exercises! Here we have various function word problems for you to solve, again in a notebook and we will cover the solutions in a video 

afterwards.

Best of luck! If you have any questions, post to the QA forums and we'll be happy to help you out!
