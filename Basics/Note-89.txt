Lecture-127 and 128: Python Image Exercises - Overview and Solutions 

Image Exercise - Solution

In the folder "Working with Images" (same folder this notebook is located in) there are two images we will be working with:

	- word_matrix.png
	- mask.png

The word_matrix is a .png image that contains a spreadsheet of words with a hidden message in it.

Your task is to use the mask.png image to reveal the hidden message inside the word_matrix.png. Keep in mind, you may need to resize the mask.png in order for this to work.

This exercise is more open-ended, so we won't guide you with the steps, instead, letting you explore and figure things out on your own as you would in a real world situation. However, if 
you get stuck, you can always view the solutions video or notebook for guidance. Best of luck!


Import Images

In[1]: from PIL import Image

In[2]: words = Image.open('word_matrix.png')

In[3]: words

In[4]: mask = Image.open("mask.png")

In[5]: mask


Resize Images to Match

In[6]: mask.size

Out[6]: (505, 251)

In[8]: words.size

Out[8]: (1015, 559)

In[12]: mask = mask.resize((1015,559))

In[13]: mask.size

Out[13]: (1015, 559)


Add in alpha parameter

Now we can't just paste them over, otherwise we won't see what is underneath, we need to add an alpha value.

In[14]: mask.putalpha(200)

        # links.putalpha(128)

In[15]: mask

In[16]: words.paste(mask,(0,0),mask)

In[17]: words
