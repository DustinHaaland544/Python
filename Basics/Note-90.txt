Lecture-129: Introduction to PDFs and Spreadsheets with Python


PDFs and Spreadsheets

1. Python has the ability to work with PDF files and spreadsheet files. 

2. In this section we will explore libraries that allow us to interact with these files. 

3. Note: We highly recommend you work in the same location as the lecture notebooks since we will be referencing many files in that location.
