Lecture-77: Pip Install and PyPi


Modules and Packages

Using PyPi With pip install

1. PyPi is a repository for open-source third party Python packages. 

2. It's similar to RubyGems in the Ruby world, PHP's Packagist, CPAN for Perl, and NPM for Node.js.

3. So far we have really only used libraries that come internally with Python.

4. There are many other libraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi.

5. We can use "pip install" at the command line to install these packages.

6. By installing Python from python.org or through the Anaconda distribution you also installed "pip".

7. "pip" is a simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository. 

8. There are packages already created for almost any use case you can think of!

9. A quick google search will usually help you discover a link to the PyPi page for the package, or for the package documentation. 

10. Let's quickly show you how to download and install external packages.
