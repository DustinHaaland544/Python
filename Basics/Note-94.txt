Lecture-134: Introduction to Emails with Python 


Emails with Python 

1. In this section we will explore how to send emails with Python and how to check our inbox for received messages. 

2. Please keep in mind this process is highly reliant on admin privileges on both your local computer, your internet, and your email. 

3. It is highly likely that on a corporate network, work computer, or work email these methods will be blocked for security reasons. 

4. If you encounter issues due to this, please contact your IT department, as it is not an issue we can fix on our end. 

5. Lastly, there is no full exercise for these topics, since there is no real way we can create true self-assessments for a personal email address. 

6. However, we do provide a notebook with some ideas for you to explore, we encourage you to get creative!
