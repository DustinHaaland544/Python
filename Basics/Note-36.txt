Lecture-42: Introduction To Functions

Functions

1. Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer.

2. "Functions" allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times, without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code.

3. Functions will be a huge leap forward in your capabilities as a Python programmer. 

4. This means that the problems you are able to solve can also be a lot harder!

5. It is very important to get practice combining everything you've learned so far (control flow, loops, etc.) with functions to become an effective programmer. 

6. This may be a point in your progress where you may get discouraged or fraustrated, do not worry, this is completely normal and very common.

7. We will guide you step by step, be patient with yourself and practice, practice, practice!!

8. Be patient with yourself.

9. Take your time to practice the material.

10. Start getting excited about your new skills and start thinking about personal projects.

11. Let's learn how to create functions with Python!
