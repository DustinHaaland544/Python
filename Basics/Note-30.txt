Lecture-36: While Loops in Python 

While Loops

1. While loops will continue to execute a block of code "while" some condition remains True. 

2. For example, "while" my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water.

3. Or "while" my dogs are still hungry, keep feeding my dogs.

4. Syntax of a while loop

	while some_boolean_condition:

		# do something

	else:

		# do something different

             print("X IS NOT LESS THAN 5")

Out[4]: X IS NOT LESS THAN 5


5. break, continue, pass

   We can use break, continue, pass statements in our loops to add additional functionality for various cases. The three statements are defined by:

	- break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.

	- continue: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop.

	- pass: Does nothing at all.


In[6]: x = [1, 2, 3]

       for item in x:

		# comment

Out[6]: File "<ipython-input-6-b7255e8c2a99>", line 4

        SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

In[7]: x = [1, 2, 3]

	 for item in x: 

		# comment

		pass

	 print('end of my script')

Out[7]: end of my script
