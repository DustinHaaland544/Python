Lecture-15: Introduction To Strings

Strings

1. Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes:

	- 'hello'

	- "Hello"

	- "I don't do that"

2. Because strings are "ordered sequences" it means we can use "indexing" and "slicing" to grab sub-sections of the string.

3. Indexing notation uses [] notation after the string (or variable assigned the string).

4. Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string...

5. These actions use [] square brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab

Character: h e l l o

Index: 0 1 2 3 4

Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1  

6. Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the string.

7. This has the following syntax:

	- "[start : stop : step]"

8. "start" is a numerical index for the slice start

9. "stop" is the index you will go up to (but not include)

10. "step" is the size of the "jump" you take

In[6]: 'hello'

Out[6]: 'hello'

In[7]: "world"

Out[7]: 'world'

In[8]: 'this is also a string'

Out[8]: 'this is also a string'

In[10]: "I'm going on a run"

Out[10]: "I'm going on a run"

In[11]: print("hello")

	  hello

In[12]: "hello world one"

	  "hello world two"

Out[12]: 'hello world two'

In[13]: print("hello world one")

	  print("hello world two")

        hello world one 

        hello world two 

In[15]: print('hello \n world')

	  hello 

	  world

In[18]: len('hello')

Out[18]: 5

In[19]: len('I am')

Out[19]: 4
