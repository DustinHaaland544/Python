Lecture-11: Introduction to Python Data Types

*Basic Data Types

1. In this section of the course we will cover the key data types in Python.

2. These are your basic building blocks when constructing larger pieces of code.

3. Let's quickly discuss all of the possible data types, then we will have lectures that go into more detail about each one!
