Lecture-131: Working with PDF Files in Python


Working with PDF Files

1. PDF stands for Portable Document Format and was developed by Adobe in the 1990s. 

2. The most important thing to keep in mind is that while PDFs share the same extension and can be viewed in PDF readers, many PDFs are "not" machine readable through Python. 

3. Since PDFs mainly encapsulate and display a fixed-layout flat document, there is no machine readable standard format, unlike CSV files. 

4. This means that a PDF that was simply scanned is highly unlikely to be readable. 

5. Additions to PDFs such as images, tables, format adjustments can also render a PDF unreadable by Python. 

6. There are many paid PDF programs that can read and extract from these files, but will use the open-source and free "PyPDF2" library. 

7. We have made sure that the PDF files included in this course material are readable by PyPDF2. 

8. Unfortunately, we cannot offer assistance for your own personal PDF files if they are not readable by PyPDF2. 

9. Let's explore working with PDF files in Python. 

10. Remember you will first need to install PyPDF2 at your command line: 

	- pip install PyPDF2
