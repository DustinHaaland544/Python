Lecture-29: Resources for More Basic Practice

Resources for More Basic Practice

Before you begin your assessment, I wanted to point out some helpful links for practice (don't worry about being able to do these exercises, I just want you to be aware of the links so you

can visit them later, since we still haven't discussed functions, you won't be able to utilize a lot of these resources yet!):

1. Basic Practice: http://codingbat.com/python

2. More Mathematical (and harder) Practice: https://projecteuker.net/archives

3. List of Practice Problems: http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_list

4. A SubReddit Devoted to Daily Practice Problems: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

5. A very tricky website with very few hints and touch problems (not for beginners but still interesting): http://www.pythonchallenge.com/
