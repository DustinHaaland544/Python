Lecture-8: Running Python Code

1. There are several ways to run Python code. 

2. First let's discuss the various options for development environments.

3. There are 3 main types of environments:

	- Text Editors

	- Full IDEs

	- Notebook Environments

4. Text Editors

	- General editors for any text file

	- Work with a variety of files types

	- Can be customized with plugins and add-ons

	- Keep in mind, most are not designed with only Python in mind 

	- "Most popular: Sublime Text and Atom"

5. Full IDEs

	- Development Environments designed specifically for Python

	- Larger programs

	- Only community editions are free

	- Designed specifically for Python, lots of extra functionality

	- "Most popular: PyCharm and Spyder"

6. Notebook Environments

	- Great for learning

	- See input and output next to each other

	- Support in-line markdowns notes, visualizations, videos, and more

	- Special file formats that are not .py

	- "Most popular is Jupyter Notebook"

7. Most important note:

	- Development Environments are a personal choice, highly dependent on personal preference.

	- "Choose whichever development environment you prefer!"


myexample.py

print('hello world')


Running the Python file,

Command Prompt

C:\Users\Marcial > cd Desktop

C:\Users\Marcial\Desktop > python myexample.py

hello world


Jupyter Notebook

In[1]: print('hello')
